# User Management Dashboard (I've generated README.md using AI)

## Overview

The **User Management Dashboard** is a mid-level React.js application built using **TypeScript** and **Material UI**. It allows users to:

- View a list of users fetched from an external API.
- Add new users locally, which will be displayed alongside the fetched users.
- Handle loading and error states during API fetching.

This project demonstrates proficiency in React.js, TypeScript, state management, API handling, and user interface design.

## Components

### 1. **UserList**
   - **Location**: `src/components/UserList.tsx`
   - **Purpose**: Fetches users from the third-party API and displays them in a Material UI table.
   - **Props**: Accepts a list of users to display both API-fetched users and locally added users.
   - **Features**:
     - Displays a loading spinner while the data is being fetched.
     - Shows an error message if the API request fails.

### 2. **AddUserForm**
   - **Location**: `src/components/AddUserForm.tsx`
   - **Purpose**: Provides a form for adding new users locally.
   - **Props**: Accepts a function to add a new user to the list.
   - **Features**:
     - Form validation for required fields.
     - Resets form fields after submission.

## API Integration

- The application uses Axios to fetch user data from `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`. The data is displayed in a Material UI table format.

## Error Handling and Loading States

- Proper error messages are shown if the API request fails.
- A loading spinner is displayed while fetching data from the API.

## UI/UX

- The application utilizes Material UI components for a clean and responsive design. The layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user editing and deletion functionality.
- Add form validation for email and phone number fields.
- Enhance styling for better user experience.
- Use context or state management libraries (like Redux) for global state management.
